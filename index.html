          <strong>May 20, 2025 - </strong> “I actually had one of my contracts taken away because they wanted to cut the cost on it,” one veteran-owned small disadvantaged business owner said. The company operates in both the federal and private sectors. Their largest contract was with the federal government, but in February they were asked in an email to reduce the cost significantly.</p>

          <p>“They wanted a crazy discount and I just couldn't do it,” the owner said. “It would put me out of business if I did that.” 
          
        </p>
      
      <p>The owner did not want to be identified because they have other remaining contracts with the government and they are a big part of their revenue stream. How the contract was terminated suddenly has been a challenge for the owner. “It’s impacting our day-to-day operations,” the person said. 
      </p>       
      <p>
        Small disadvantaged businesses have been disproportionately impacted by federal contract terminations by executive order. 
        </p>
       <p>While SDBs only account for 12% of federal procurement dollars, they made up around a third of contracts terminated by value under President Donald Trump’s executive orders to dismantle DEI and cut costs, according to analysis of data from the Federal Procurement Database System extracted and published by GovWinIQ. Three in 10 contracts canceled by executive order belonged to an SDB. </p>

          Out of proportion 
        </div>
        <p>
          Michael Negron, former special assistant in economic policy to President Joe Biden, and now policy fellow at the Groundwork Collaborative, said the ratio of federal contract terminations falling on SDBs seemed high.  
        </p>
        <p>
          “It is out of proportion to their share of contracting,” he said. 
        </p>
        <p>
          SDB procurement made up around 12% of total federal procurement by value in fiscal year 2023, the latest data from the Small Business Association, a government agency.

        </div>
        <p>
          Negron said the data suggested “a focus on SDBs, whether SDBs as SDBs, or they’re focusing on ‘DEI’ and it is disproportionately hitting SDBs.” 

        </p>
        <p>
          He added, “canceling DEI contracts is not a perfect proxy for overall SDBs. But it is suggestive of an attitude towards diversity in contracting.” 

        </p>
        <p>Small disadvantaged businesses are majority owned and controlled by one or more disadvantaged persons. They must be socially disadvantaged, meaning they belong to groups who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias, and economically disadvantaged

        </div>
        <p>Several categories of federal contracting and bidding processes known as set asides and sole source are limited to businesses certified as disadvantaged in some way. But businesses can also self-certify as being disadvantaged and bid for contracts outside of these brackets, and they are included in federal procurement spending for SDBs. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The SBA typically considers manufacturing firms with 500 or less employees, and non-manufacturing businesses with annual receipts under $7.5 million, to be a small business.
        </p>
        <p>
          That means small businesses in general, and small disadvantaged businesses in particular, tend to have less capacity to weather sudden major contract terminations. 
        </p>
        <p>Added to that, the government has been dismantling perceived DEI positions, policies and programs, which decreases support for small disadvantaged businesses and could impact their chances of winning contracts in the future. 
        </p>
        <p>The extent and breakdown of contract terminations by the second Trump administration has been hard to pin down, because the government has not published summary data or reliable data overall. DOGE’s website lists the contracts they claim to have cancelled and the amount of money they are saving. But numerous serious errors have been found, including contracts concluded years before being included in the list.</p>
        <p>There are also delays to contract terminations showing up in the government data. It takes federal contracts 30 days to be updated in the system, with Department of Defense contracts taking 90 days. </p>
        <p>GovWinIQ, Deltek’s government procurement database platform, has been publishing contract termination data extracted from the government’s centralized Federal Procurement Data System. GovWinIQ’s data lists federal contracts that have been terminated for any reason since January 20, updated weekly.</p>
        <p>A unique feature of federal contracting is that the government can unilaterally terminate a contract, known as “termination for convenience,” which is being used to carry out executive orders. Terminations for convenience have skyrocketed under the second Trump administration, and 1,340 of the roughly 16,385 canceled contracts explicitly cited “Executive Order,” “EOI,” or “EO.”
        </p>
        <p>Until recently, federal procurement was considered a coveted stable income for smaller businesses. The federal government is the single largest buyer of products and services in the U.S., spending $759 billion in fiscal year 2023. Before the change in administration, there was a  target to spend 15% of federal procurement on SDBs by 2025. With that system now erased, the target is set to revert to the statutory requirement of 5%. </p>
        <p>With the administration’s directive to dismantle DEI positions, policies, and initiatives, the outlook for small disadvantaged businesses is bleak. The SBA programs introduced under Biden to support and encourage participation of disadvantaged business owners through access to loans are on the chopping block, and consolidating federal procurement in the GSA gatekeepers smaller, less experienced businesses from competing. 
        </p>
        <p>Ben Johnston, COO of Kapitus, a small business lender, said, “it is safe to say that many aspects of these programs will be eliminated, impacting disadvantaged businesses disproportionately.” 
        </p>
        <p>The Government Contractors Association represents around 3,000 small disadvantaged businesses. Several have been impacted by terminations including one who had a DEI training contract. </p>

          “When they lose the contract it is significant, because these small businesses, they may only have one, two contracts,” explained Government Contractos Association Founder and President Abraham Xiong.

        <p>“When they lose the contract it is significant, because these small businesses, they may only have one, two contracts,” explained founder and president Abraham Xiong. 
        </p>
        <p>“So to lose a contract, that could be 50% of the revenue, and it's hard, not only for the business owner, it's hard for even the employees that work for them.”  He said some are on the verge of closing their doors, while others have had to lay off personnel tied to the contract. Many may miss out on claiming back funds in the panic of the moment.</p>
        <p>Having worked in the industry for 16 years, Xiong said he has seen the ebbs and flow in federal contracting when administrations change. “This is the most drastic. But the government's not going anywhere, and we're still going to see growth once we go through the cuts,” he asserted.
