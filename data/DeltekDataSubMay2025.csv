THE PILOT PHASE OF THE CIP WOULD TAKE PLACE IN GHANA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH GRAND CHALLENGES CANADA. IT WOULD ISSUE AN INNOVATION CALL TO PROVIDE INITIAL, CATALYTIC FUNDING OF CAD $2.5 MILLION ACROSS APPROXIMATELY 10 INNOVATORS (USD $200K EACH) OVER 6-12 MONTHS TO APPLY THEIR APPROACH TO IMMEDIATE NEEDS. THE CIP CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS:  SCOPE INNOVATION NEEDS THROUGH A LOCALLY-LED PROCESS THAT WOULD IDENTIFY A HIGH-PRIORITY HEALTH NEED OR PORTFOLIO OF NEEDS AND DEFINE THE SELECTION CRITERIA FOR EVALUATING RELEVANT INNOVATIONS. THIS PROCESS AIMS TO IDENTIFY, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GOVERNMENT, EXISTING INITIATIVES THAT INNOVATIONS COULD INTEGRATE INTO, AND PROVIDE CLARITY ON DEMAND AND FINANCING SOURCES. THIS APPROACH WOULD ENTAIL A SERIES OF DESIGN WORKSHOPS WITH MOH/GHS, USAID IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS, AND OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING HEALTH PROVIDERS, LOCAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS/UNIVERSITIES, COMMUNITY MEMBERS, LOCAL ADVOCATES, FAITH LEADERS, AND MORE. THE DISCUSSIONS WOULD SURFACE GOALS, STRENGTHS, AND CONSTRAINTS IN THE HEALTH SECTOR, HELPING INFORM HOW TO IDENTIFY AND ENABLE THE USE OF INNOVATIONS. THE WORKSHOPS WOULD ALSO DEFINE THE CRITERIA AND EVALUATION PROCESS FOR ASSESSING INNOVATIONS AND IDENTIFY THE JUDGES FOR THE INNOVATION CALL.   LAUNCH AN INNOVATION CALL BASED ON THE DEFINED SCOPE AND SELECTION CRITERIA, APPLYING THE EVALUATION PROCESS WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AS KEY DECISION MAKERS. THE OPEN INNOVATION CALL WOULD FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE PREDEFINED HEALTH NEED, LIKELY TARGETED AT GHANA-BASED INNOVATORS AT A GROWTH OR SCALING STAGE.   SUPPORT SELECT INNOVATORS WITH APPROXIMATELY $200K EACH THROUGH MILESTONE-BASED PAYMENTS OVER 6-12 MONTHS TO HELP FUND THE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR SCALING OF INNOVATIONS. THE CIP AIMS TO CREATE A COMMUNITY OF GLOBAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING LOCAL INNOVATORS AS PART OF THE BROADER INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM IN GHANA. STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATING IN THE INITIAL DESIGN WORKSHOPS WOULD IDEALLY SERVE AS CHAMPIONS AND ADVISORS FOR WINNING INNOVATORS, HELPING MAP HOW WINNING INNOVATIONS COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO ONGOING HEALTH PROGRAMS, WHETHER SUPPORTED BY THE MOH, MISSION, OTHER DONORS, OR THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THEIR PATHWAYS TO SCALE.   OUTLINE LESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES TO INFORM THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ONGOING PLATFORM THAT COULD ROUTINELY DEFINE HEALTH NEEDS AND INFORM HOW LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS SOURCE, ACCESS, AND USE INNOVATIONS. THIS WOULD ALSO BE SHARED WITH AN EYE TOWARDS REPLICABILITY IN OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION TO THE CIP, THERE ARE BROADER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO BOLSTERING A COUNTRY-LEVEL INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE CIP FOCUS. THESE COULD INCLUDE MAPPING EXISTING INNOVATION ACCELERATOR PROGRAMS, IDENTIFYING AND ENABLING  OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE INNOVATIONS IN MOH/GHS PROGRAMS BEYOND THE CIPÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S FOCUS, SHARING LESSONS LEARNED WITH HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS WHO OPERATE IN HEALTH AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE CIPÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S FOCUS, AND FOSTERING A BROADER NETWORK OF INNOVATORS THAT INCLUDES PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOT SELECTED BY THE CIP BUT WHO COULD STILL BENEFIT FROM ENGAGEMENT WITH THE MOH/GHS OR OTHER LOCAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS. THE PLACEMENT OF A MANAGEMENT PARTNER WITHIN THE GHANA HEALTH SERVICE WHO WOULD WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO BOLSTER THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM TO MEET HEALTH NEEDS. THE PRINCIPAL FOCUS OF THESE EFFORTS WILL BE ENSURING THE CIP INNOVATION CALL AND ITS SUPPORTED INNOVATIONS RESPOND TO COUNTRY PRIORITIES. KEY RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT PARTNER INCLUDE: SERVE AS THE IN-COUNTRY COORDINATOR OF THE CIP TO IDENTIFY AND ENGAGE KEY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, THE USAID MISSION, AND RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS IN THE CIP, AND COORDINATE WITH INNOVATION SUPPORT NETWORKS AND ORGANIZATIONS; ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY OF PUBLIC SECTOR OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER GREATER UPTAKE OF INNOVATIONS, PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE CIP CO-CREATION PROCESS AND BEYOND; WORK CLOSELY WITH MCKINSEY & PARTNERS TO PLAN FOR AND FACILITATE HUMAN-CENTERED DESIGN WORKSHOPS WITH MOH/GHS AND OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. THESE WORKSHOPS WILL IDENTIFY HEALTH PRIORITIES THAT WARRANT INNOVATION SUPPORT AND DESIGN THE CALL FOR INNOVATION, INCLUDING JUDGE SELECTION, THE CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND INNOVATOR ENGAGEMENT; LAUNCH THE CALL FOR INNOVATIONS, INCLUDING PUBLICIZING THE CALL IN COLLABORATION WITH MCKINSEY; CONVENE AND FACILITATE EVALUATION DISCUSSIONS WITH  A SUBSET OF STAKEHOLDERS TO JUDGE AND SELECT WINNERS; DEVELOP A PLAN TO SUPPORT WINNING INNOVATIONS BY CULTIVATING GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTS WITH INNOVATORS, DEFINING INDIVIDUAL SCALING PATHWAYS, AND COORDINATING INNOVATOR COHORT LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES OVER APPROXIMATELY 6-12 MONTHS. RECONVENE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INNOVATOR SUPPORT PERIOD TO ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS OF PLATFORM; DOCUMENT LESSONS LEARNED AND DEVELOP A GUIDEBOOK FOR ESTABLISHING AN ONGOING PLATFORM FOR REGULAR STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT THAT CAN CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT INNOVATORS; RAISE AWARENESS OF AND APPETITE FOR INNOVATION WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND BUILD CAPACITY TO SUPPORT INNOVATION PATHWAYS, INCLUDING DEVELOPING GOVERNMENT INNOVATION CHAMPIONS.  BOLSTER THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM BEYOND DIRECT CIP ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ENCOURAGING OPPORTUNITIES TO INTEGRATE INNOVATIONS IN MOH/GHS PROGRAMS, AND FOSTERING NETWORKS OF INNOVATORS BEYOND THOSE SELECTED IN THE CIP, THROUGH ENGAGEMENT WITH KEY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS AND INSIGHTS INTO GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES.  THE CIP AIMS TO ACCOMPLISH THREE GOALS:  SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH INNOVATORS AND DEMONSTRATE FEASIBILITY OF THE CIP BY PROVIDING FUNDING, GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER CONNECTIONS, AND OFFERING CROSS-LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AS PART OF A CIP INNOVATOR COHORT. IDENTIFY AND STRENGTHEN PATHWAYS FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO ENGAGE WITH AND SUPPORT INNOVATORS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE CIP COHORT), FROM PRIORITIZING HEALTH NEEDS RELEVANT FOR INNOVATION TO EMBEDDING INNOVATIONS INTO ONGOING PROGRAMS.

2/14/25,2025,5395.76,2025.038.DELOITTE&TOUCHE.SUB / T,"1. GENERALA. BACKGROUND(1) ACCORDING TO PRESIDENTIAL POLICY DIRECTIVE 8: NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS (PPD-8), THE NATION MUST MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS FOR THE FULL SPECTRUM OF HAZARDS AND THREATS WHICH FACE THE COUNTRY. NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS REQUIRES EFFORTS TO BE MADE ACROSS FIVE MISSION AREAS: PREVENTION, PROTECTION, RESPONSE, RECOVERY, AND MITIGATION. THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCYÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S (FEMA) MANDATE IS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CAPABILITY TO PREPARE FOR, PROTECT AGAINST, RESPOND TO, RECOVER FROM, AND MITIGATE ALL HAZARDS. MOST OF THE PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS FEMA CONDUCTS ARE FOCUSED ON ALL-HAZARDS PREPAREDNESS. REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE, FEMA MAINTAINS THE PERSONNEL, SUPPLIES, AUTHORITIES, TOOLS, AND CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND TO ANY HAZARD.(2) ON FEBRUARY 3, 2022, THE FEMA ADMINISTRATOR ISSUED A MEMO TITLED Ã¢Â‚¬Å“PREPAREDNESS STRATEGY FOR THE EMERGING THREAT OF CYBER INCIDENTS WITH PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES.Ã¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ ALTHOUGH CYBER-ATTACKS WITH DISRUPTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES WERE DESCRIBED, THE MEMO DIRECTED THE AGENCY Ã¢Â‚¬Å“TO ADOPT A MORE CONCERTED APPROACH TO STRENGTHENING OUR OWN READINESS AND HELPING OUR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, TRIBAL, AND TERRITORIAL PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN THEIRS.Ã¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ THE FEMA CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL AND NUCLEAR (CBRN) OFFICE WITHIN ORR IS DIRECTED TO FOCUS BEYOND THE CBRN ENTERPRISE (WHILE STILL SUSTAINING AND ENHANCING CBRN ENTERPRISE) TO EMERGING THREATS NOT INVOLVING CBRN. THE NEW OET WILL ADDRESS UNIQUE CHALLENGES POSED BY THESE THREATS AND ASSOCIATED HAZARDS WITH AN IMMEDIATE EMPHASIS ON CYBER INCIDENTS WITH PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES.(3) AN Ã¢Â‚¬Å“EMERGING THREATÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ IS DEFINED AS ONE THAT MAY BE NEWLY RECOGNIZED; MAY HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BEFORE, BUT WITH NEW OR DIFFERENT IMPACTS; OR MAY BE AN EXISTING THREAT THAT HAS DEVELOPED NEW ATTRIBUTES THAT POSE A CHALLENGE TO EXISTING FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER CORE CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND AND TO RECOVER FROM SUCH THREATS AND HAZARDS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE CYBER-ATTACKS, RESURGENT NATION-STATE THREATS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AMONG OTHERS. ADDRESSING SUCH THREATS REQUIRES CLOSE LINKAGES BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE, DATA ANALYTICS, AND ASSESSED RISK TO DRIVE FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT, PLANNING, AND OPERATIONS.(4) THE VISION OF OET IS TO HELP FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS A WIDE ARRAY OF NOVEL EMERGING THREATS. OET REPRESENTS THE Ã¢Â‚¬Å“BRIDGEÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½ NEEDED TO FILL THE GAP BETWEEN EMERGING THREATS IDENTIFIED BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY (IC) OR OTHER INFORMATION SOURCES, AND THE RISK-INFORMED DEVELOPMENT, MANAGEMENT, AND DELIVERY OF FEMA AND MISSION PARTNER OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.(5) MISSION: THE MISSION OF OET IS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, AND INFORM FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS OF EMERGING THREATS THAT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGE THE NATIONÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S CORE CAPABILITIES FOR INCIDENT RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. THIS MISSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATORÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S 2022 ANNUAL PLANNING GUIDANCE AND OBJECTIVE 3.2 (Ã¢Â‚¬Å“POSTURE FEMA TO MEET CURRENT AND EMERGING THREATSÃ¢Â‚¬Ï¿½) OF THE 2022-2026 FEMA STRATEGIC PLAN. IT IS ALSO ALIGNED WITH FEMA THREAT AND HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT (THIRA) DOCTRINE.(A) GOAL 1: DEVELOP A COLLABORATIVE FOCAL POINT WITHIN FEMA TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE ENTITIES INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TO THE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS EMERGING THREATS AND CORRESPONDING RISKS TO INFORM AND ENABLE FEMA AND ITS MISSION PARTNERS TO RESPOND AND RECOVER FROM SUCH THREATS.(B) GOAL 2: USING A COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP APPROACH, TRANSLATE ANALYSIS OF THREATS AND RELATED RISKS INTO ACTIONABLE GUIDANCE AND INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIZED PLANS, RESOURCES, AND CAPABILITIES TO ADDRESS GAPS RELATED TO SPECIFIC EMERGING THREATS IN COORDINATION WITH RELEVANT INTRA AND INTERAGENCY AND MISSION PARTNERS. (C) GOAL 3: ENHANCE FEMAÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S CAPABILITIES TO RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM EMERGING THREATS ONCE SUCH THREATS ARE ACTUALIZED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY.(D) GOAL 4: STRENGTHEN PARTNERSHIPS AND INFORMATION SHARING BETWEEN FEMA",DELOITTE LLP,NULL,USA,VA,ARLINGTON,22209,541611,Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services,70FA5024A00000004,70FA5024F00000127,"BRYCE SPACE AND TECHNOLOGY, LLC",Limited Liability Company|SBA-Certified Women-Owned Small Business|Small Business (in one or more NAICS)|Women-Owned|Women-Owned Small Business,HOMELAND SECURITY,FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY,OFFICE OF RESPONSE & RECOVERY,

PERCEIVED LACK OF INVESTMENT READINESS OF SUCH START-UPS TO BE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN COMPETE FOR, AND TAKE ON, OUTSIDE CAPITAL AND EQUITY COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THIS COULD BE DUE TO A MYRIAD OF FACTORS INCLUDING INADEQUACY OF PROGRAMS PROVIDED BY EXISTING INCUBATORS/ACCELERATORS TO MAKE INNOVATIONS INVESTMENT READY, RELUCTANCE OF ENTREPRENEURS TO SURRENDER PARTIAL OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OF THEIR BUSINESS, LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FINANCE, LOW INVESTABILITY OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PROPOSITIONS, A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE KEY FACTORS INVESTORS LOOK FOR IN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS, AND PRESENTATIONAL FAILINGS SUCH AS DEFICIENCIES IN BUSINESS PITCHES. MOST INCUBATORS/ACCELERATORS SPEND THEIR EFFORTS AT BUILDING THE BASIC BUSINESS SKILLS OF START-UPS INCLUDING TEACHING THEM HOW TO WRITE A BUSINESS PLAN, AND NOT ON READYING INNOVATIVE FIRMS TO ATTRACT EQUITY FINANCE.

IN 2010, PATH LICENSED THE SILCS TECHNOLOGY TO KESSEL MENDINTIM GMBH (KESSEL) TO MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZE THE PRODUCT. KESSEL MARKETS THIS AS THE CAYAÃ‚Â® CONTOURED DIAPHRAGM.  IN RECENT YEARS, KESSEL HAS BEEN MARKETING AND SELLING THE CAYA IN MORE THAN 40 COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS RELATIVELY UNKNOWN AND INACCESSIBLE TO WOMEN IN MANY LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES.

NONE OF THE EXISTING STUDIES INVESTIGATED WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY OR OTHER MARKET DYNAMICS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR PRODUCT USE IN REAL-WORLD SETTINGS. UNLIKE OTHER RELATIVELY NEWER CONTRACEPTIVES, CAYA DOES NOT HAVE A DEDICATED GLOBAL ACCESS WORKING GROUP THAT IS INVESTIGATING ACCESS ISSUES AND HOW THEY MAY BE RESOLVED.

IN SOME COUNTRIES (E.G., INDIA), CONTRACEPTIVE GELS DO NOT HAVE REGULATORY APPROVAL. ADDITIONALLY, THE CAYA IS RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH A WATER-BASED CONTRACEPTIVE GEL THAT DOES NOT HAVE NONOXYNOL-9, THE MAIN INGREDIENT IN MOST SPERMICIDE GELS. THERE ARE FEW WATER-BASED GELS AND AVAILABLE BRANDS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. THERE IS ALSO SOME CONCERN THAT THE CAYA GEL (CONTRAGEL) HAS A SHORT SHELF-LIFE IN WARM TEMPERATURES.Ã¢Â‚¬Â¯ THERE ARE MARKETS WHERE CAYA LAUNCHED  WITHOUT THE GEL; THESE LEARNINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON ADOPTION ACROSS  LMICS AND LEND INSIGHTS ON OVERCOMING  REGULATORY HURDLES Ã¢Â‚¬Â¯ GREATER AWARENESS OF ALTERNATIVE AND  AFFORDABLE CONTRACEPTIVE GELS COULD  ENHANCE UPTAKE OF THE PRODUCT.Ã¢Â‚¬Â¯  CURRENT REGULATORY AND/OR POLICY  ENVIRONMENT INHIBITS AVAILABILITY OF CONTRACEPTIVE GELSÃ¢Â‚¬Â¯   GIVEN CAYAÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S LIKELY DEMAND AMONG NICHE POPULATIONS, WE ARE CONCERNED THE PRODUCTÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S PRICE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPEDIMENT TO PROCUREMENT.

LOCAL PRIVATE HEALTH BUSINESSES, GENERALLY SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES, ENGAGED IN FP/RH CAN INCLUDE HEALTH CLINICS, PHARMACIES INVOLVED IN DIRECT PROVISION OF SERVICES, AS WELL AS OTHER HEALTH BUSINESSES LIKE E-COMMERCE FIRMS, SMALL MANUFACTURERS, WHOLESALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, DIGITAL/INFORMATION PROVIDERS, TECH OR TRANSPORT GROUPS. WOMEN OWNED OR LED BUSINESSES ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST, AS THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT AND ACCESS TO CREDIT ARE MORE LIMITED. LOCAL SOCIAL MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, WHILE OFTEN NOT FOR PROFIT OR SOCIAL ENTERPRISES, COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED.   1) CAPITAL + BUSINESS SUPPORT MODELS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED HEALTH BUSINESSES ENGAGED IN FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. OUR TEAM IS INTERESTED IN WAYS USAID MISSIONS CAN PAIR SEED CAPITAL (LIKELY GRANTS) WITH BUSINESS SUPPORT AND TRAINING/TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT A RANGE OF PLAYERS IN THE FP/RH VALUE CHAIN. THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE SOME USAID SUPPORT TO SUCH ORGANIZATIONS TO BRING THEM TO A PLACE OF INVESTMENT READINESS, AS WE RECOGNIZE EITHER THE CONTEXT AND/OR THE BUSINESS ITSELF MAY NOT BE READY FOR PRIVATE INVESTMENT.     2) INVESTMENT MODELS FOR LONGER TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF SOCIAL MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER HEALTH ENTERPRISES. IN THE PAST USAID CREATED OR SUPPORTED INVESTMENTS IN LOCAL SOCIAL MARKETING ORGANIZATIONÃ¢Â‚¬Â„¢S LONGER TERM SUSTAINABILITY - RANGING FROM ENDOWMENTS, EVERGREEN FUNDS, SINKING FUNDS, TO REAL ESTATE PURCHASES. AS USAID CONTINUES TO ADVANCE ITS EFFORTS AROUND LOCALIZATION AND TRANSITIONING TO LOCAL PARTNERS, INCLUDING LOCAL SMOS/NGOS WHO PROVIDE AND/OR HAVE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FP INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE MUST CONSIDER LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY NEEDS. USAID/MISSIONS WHO MAY BE NEWER TO THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT NEED AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LONGER TERM INVESTMENT CHANNELS AND FINANCE INSTRUMENTS/MECHANISMS.   PROPOSED ACTIVITIES A SUITE OF LANDSCAPING AND OPPORTUNITY ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN BROADEN AND DEEPEN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO SUPPORT PROMISING LOCAL PRIVATE HEALTH BUSINESSES TO ADVANCE FP/RH OUTCOMES. THESE ASSESSMENTS WILL BE DISSEMINATED WITH USAID/WASHINGTON AND MISSIONS AND CURRENT GLOBAL MECHANISMS (FHM, NPI), THROUGH BRIEFS AND WEBINARS, TO INFORM CURRENT AND FUTURE PROGRAMMING. ASSESSMENTS SHOULD BE INFORMED BY LOCAL KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND IN PERSON ENGAGEMENT THROUGH WORKSHOPS IN 1-2 COUNTRIES.  1) CAPITAL + BUSINESS SUPPORT MODELS THAT CAN SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF LOCAL SMES INVOLVED IN FP/RH: IDENTIFYING 2-3 COUNTRIES, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT FP/RH MARKETS (E.G. RANGING FROM MORE NASCENT PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT IN FP/RH TO MORE EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX), AND THEN HELP IDENTIFY/MODEL/CONSTRUCT IDEAS FOR LOCALLY APPROPRIATE MODELS OF CAPITAL/LOAN FUND ARRANGEMENTS AND BUSINESS TRAINING SERVICES SPECIFIC TO FP/RH PRIVATE SECTOR. IT SHOULD EXAMINE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY USAID MISSIONS OR OTHER DONORS OR WITH OTHER NON-HEALTH SECTORS, OR BE NEW IDEAS.   2) LANDSCAPE AND OVERVIEW OF LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL NOT FOR PROFIT OR SOCIAL ENTERPRISES FOCUSED ON DELIVERING FP INFORMATION, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A LANDSCAPE OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE FINANCING PACKAGES/MODELS THAT COULD BE EXPLORED, HOW THEY WORK, THEIR PROS AND CONS (ON BOTH USAID/DONOR OR ORGANIZATION SIDES).

A SUB-PROJECT OF THIS STUDY INVOLVES INVESTIGATION OF HOW LINE SPEED WAIVERS IMPACT EMPLOYEE RESPIRATORY EXPOSURE TO PROCESSING AIDS, IN PARTICULAR, PERACETIC ACID (PAA).

INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE SAMPLES OF AIRBORNE PAA WILL BE COLLECTED IN ALL AREAS WHERE PAA EXPOSURE TO WORKERS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR. PAA EXPOSURES TO WORKERS IMPACTED BY LINE SPEED WILL BE PRIORITIZED. THERE ARE MAINTENANCE WORKERS WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR: MAINTAINING PAA IN STORAGE; MIXING AND DELIVERING PAA TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT; MAINTAINING AND CLEANING SUPPLY LINES, BATHS, AND SPRAYS THAT USE PAA. THESE MAINTENANCE WORKERS MAY EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN EXPOSURE IF THE INCREASED LINE SPEED INCREASES THE VOLUME OF PAA USED IN THE PLANT. SINCE MAINTENANCE WORKERS WHO ARE REGULARLY EXPOSED TO PAA ARE LIKELY TO BE MONITORED BY THE PLANT, THE STUDY TEAM WILL REQUEST PAA DATA FROM COMPANY EVALUATIONS OF MAINTENANCE WORKERS; AND IF THERE IS NO DATA, A REPRESENTATIVE MAINTENANCE WORKER MAY BE SELECTED FOR EVALUATION.WORKERS INVOLVED DIRECTLY WITH PORK PRODUCT HANDLING AND PROCESSING HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF EXPOSURE TO PAA.
